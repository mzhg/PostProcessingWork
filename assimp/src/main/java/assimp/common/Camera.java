/** Helper structure to describe a virtual camera. 
*
* Cameras have a representation in the node graph and can be animated.
* An important aspect is that the camera itself is also part of the
* scenegraph. This means, any values such as the look-at vector are not 
* *absolute*, they're <b>relative</b> to the coordinate system defined
* by the node which corresponds to the camera. This allows for camera
* animations. For static cameras parameters like the 'look-at' or 'up' vectors
* are usually specified directly in aiCamera, but beware, they could also
* be encoded in the node transformation. The following (pseudo)code sample 
* shows how to do it: <br><br>
* <pre>
* // Get the camera matrix for a camera at a specific time
* // if the node hierarchy for the camera does not contain
* // at least one animated node this is a static computation
* get-camera-matrix (node sceneRoot, camera cam) : matrix
* {
*    node   cnd = find-node-for-camera(cam)
*    matrix cmt = identity()
*
*    // as usual - get the absolute camera transformation for this frame
*    for each node nd in hierarchy from sceneRoot to cnd
*      matrix cur
*      if (is-animated(nd))
*         cur = eval-animation(nd)
*      else cur = nd->mTransformation;
*      cmt = mult-matrices( cmt, cur )
*    end for
*
*    // now multiply with the camera's own local transform
*    cam = mult-matrices (cam, get-camera-matrix(cmt) )
* }
* </pre>
*
* <b>Note:</b> Some file formats (such as 3DS, ASE) export a "target point" -
* the point the camera is looking at (it can even be animated). Assimp
* writes the target point as a subnode of the camera's main node,
* called "<camName>.Target". However this is just additional information
* then the transformation tracks of the camera main node make the
* camera already look in the right direction.
*
